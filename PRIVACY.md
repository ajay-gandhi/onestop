# OneStop Privacy Policy

The OneStop app collects the minimum amount of information needed to run the
app. **No data is given to any third parties, period.**

The OneStop app will collect and store 4 exact pieces of data. These data are
stored in plaintext. They are:
  * A unique identifier assigned to you by Google. This identifier is
    *anonymous* and assured by Google to be so; in other words, given just this
    identifier alone, it is impossible to trace back to your Google account.
    It is simply a way to link your requests to the OneStop app with your saved
    preferences. See below for more information
  * An identifier representing your chosen transit agency. This identifier is
    saved in our database so that when you make requests to the OneStop app, it
    can respond with the correct prediction. This is the same reasoning for the
    remaining items below.
  * An identifier representing your chosen route.
  * An identifier representing your chosen stop.
Your chosen direction is not stored.

This data is stored in addition to any logs collected by
[Heroku](http://heroku.com), the platform on which OneStop is hosted. Please see
the [Heroku security page](https://www.google.com/search?q=heroku+privacy+policy&oq=heroku+priv&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.4059j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
for more information about Heroku and privacy.

## Your unique identifier

See [this link](https://developers.google.com/actions/identity/user-info) for
Google's summary of this identifier.

Because the identifier is anonymous, it cannot be traced back to any specific
account. Therefore, if you would like your data to be deleted, please do so by
deleting this app from Google Assistant on your account and following any other
instructions provided by Google.

## Why is this data collected and stored?

These preferences are collected and stored so that when you talk to the OneStop
app through Google Assistant, the app can immediately provide you with a
prediction for the saved public transit stop. If this data were not stored, you
would have to undergo the 4-step setup process each time you talk to the app,
which would defeat the purpose and convenience of it to begin with.
